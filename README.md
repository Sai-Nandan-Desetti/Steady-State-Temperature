# Steady-State-Temperature
Compute the steady-state temperature of a two-dimensional homogenous plate by randomly walking on the plate

## Reference
The sequential code for the random walk is from [here](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci493.65/lecture_notes/chapter08.pdf).
