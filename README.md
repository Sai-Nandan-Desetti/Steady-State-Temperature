# Steady-State-Temperature
Compute the steady-state temperature of a two-dimensional homogenous plate by randomly walking on the plate

## Problem Statement
*Imagine a very thin plate of homogeneous material. Compute the steady-state
temperature at a particular point in the plate. The top and the bottom of the
plate are insulated, and the temperature at any point is solely determined by
the temperatures surrounding it, except for the temperatures at the edges of the
plate, which are fixed.*

## Reference
